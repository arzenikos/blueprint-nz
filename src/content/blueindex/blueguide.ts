    <strong>Abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®)</strong> is a selective, irreversible CYP17 inhibitor used in combination with prednisone for treating <strong>metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)</strong>.

    It blocks androgen biosynthesis, prolongs survival, and improves symptoms in both pre- and post-chemotherapy settings. It is now <strong>PHARMAC-funded in New Zealand</strong> under Special Authority.

            Abiraterone inhibits CYP17 enzymes (17α-hydroxylase and C17,20-lyase), blocking androgen synthesis in the adrenal glands and tumor microenvironment.

            Leads to ↓ testosterone and ↑ mineralocorticoids → side effects like hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema.<br>
